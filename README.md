# RARBG-self-hosted
It's a quick and dirty php site i threw together to access the rarbg_db
It was originally set up on IIS version 10 using PHP and SQLITE3

Terrible code

#  Quick start

Install IIS 10, throw the php files into wwwroot, set up PHP, install PHP Manager 1.5.0 for IIS 10 - check there are no errors- fix if necessary, enable php_sqlite3.dll
Drop your rarbg_db.sqlite to the root where your php files are and navigate to http://localhost/
